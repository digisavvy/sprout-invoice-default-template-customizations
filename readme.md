# Sprout Invoices Default Template Customizations
**This is a theme override for the `default` theme for Sprout Invoices.**

**To use this project, you will need**
* Sprout Invoices (_Sprout Invoices Pro is optional, but just buy it. It's good!_)
* In your active theme, create a folder named `sa_templates` and then copy/clone these files into it.

**Helpful Notes**
Some of the styles are generated using Sass (_scss_). I used CodeKit (_MacOSx_). There are other Win alternatives out there.
